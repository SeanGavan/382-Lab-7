# 382-Lab-7 - Using IR Sensors With LEDs
## Objectives
The goal of the lab was to use the three IR sensor/receiver pairs on the bot to detect if objects were close by, and, if so, turning on the corresponding LED (left, right, both for center).

## Software flow chart
1) Define Threshold constants
2) Setup ADC10 on the MSP430 (main)
3) Establish LED's as output (main)
4) Sample ADC10 input channel (for loop)
5) Convert reading to a voltage (for loop)
6) Compare voltage to threshold for respective side (for loop)
7) Turn LED on or off (if statement)
8) Repeat for each channel (for loop)
9) Infinite for loop (4 to 9)

## Well-formatted code
```
#include <msp430.h> 

/*
 * main.c
 */
int THRESHOLDLEFT = 0x3B0;		// Threshold voltage for wall prescence
int THRESHOLDRIGHT = 0x0FF;
int THRESHOLDCENTER = 0x3D0;

void main(void) {
    WDTCTL = WDTPW | WDTHOLD;				  // Stop watchdog timer
    ADC10CTL0 = ADC10SHT_3 + ADC10ON + ADC10IE; 		  // 64 ADC clks to combat loading, ADC10ON
    ADC10AE0 |= BIT1 + BIT2 + BIT4;           // P1.1, P1.2, P1.4 to ADC mode (A1,A2,A4)
    ADC10CTL1 |= ADC10SSEL1|ADC10SSEL0;       // Select SMCLK
    P1DIR |= BIT0 + BIT6;

    for (;;) {
    	ADC10CTL1 = INCH_4;				// Right receiver A4
    	ADC10CTL0 |= ENC + ADC10SC;   // Sampling and conversion start
    	__bis_SR_register(CPUOFF + GIE);        // LPM0, ADC10_ISR will force exit
     	if (ADC10MEM > THRESHOLDRIGHT) {  // If wall is close
         	P1OUT |= BIT6;				// P1.6 on
     	} else {
     		P1OUT &= ~BIT6;				// P1.6 off
     	}

    	ADC10CTL1 = INCH_1;				// Left receiver A1
    	ADC10CTL0 |= ENC + ADC10SC;     
    	 __bis_SR_register(CPUOFF + GIE);        
    	if (ADC10MEM < THRESHOLDLEFT) {		// Wall close (less V when wall is close)
    		P1OUT |= BIT0;             // P1.0 LED on
    	} else {						// Wall close
    		P1OUT &= ~BIT0;              // P1.0 LED off
    	}

    	ADC10CTL1 = INCH_2;				// Center receiver A2
    	ADC10CTL0 |= ENC + ADC10SC;
    	 __bis_SR_register(CPUOFF + GIE);       
    	if (ADC10MEM < THRESHOLDCENTER) { // Also less V when wall is close
    		P1OUT |= BIT0 + BIT6;				// Both on
    	} else {
    		P1OUT &= ~(BIT0 + BIT6);				// Both off
    	}
   }
}

// ADC10 interrupt service routine
#pragma vector=ADC10_VECTOR
__interrupt void ADC10_ISR(void)
{
	ADC10CTL0 &= ~ENC;        // Stop samping
  __bic_SR_register_on_exit(CPUOFF);        // Clear CPUOFF bit from 0(SR)
}
```
## Debugging
`ADC10MEM` not changing for each input channel. FIX: Declare input channel individually. `INCH_X` refers to what the active channel is. Each channel has to be declared and then sampled individually in order to get each `ACD10MEM` value. I also added the interrupt included in the class notes so that there would be time to stop samping and convert the signal to a voltage.

## Testing methodology
Ran the program through the debugger to see how `ADC10MEM` would change - found that the center and left receivers would read a lower voltage as an object got closer as opposed to the higher-voltage-if-a-wall-is-closer idea. Right receiver worked normally. This also changed the threshold values since each receiver was different. I had to find the base line voltages and then the voltages for when a wall was close to each receiver. This resulted in the threshold constants in the above code.  

## Observations and Conclusions

## Documentation
I used the class notes as a template for coding the ADC10 on the MSP430.
